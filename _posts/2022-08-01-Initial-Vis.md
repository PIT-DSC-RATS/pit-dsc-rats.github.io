## Line Graphs

![Non-Stacked](\img\initial_vis\mari_Graph_Non-Stacked_3x5.png)

This graph shows the rat population over the years separated into boroughs. We can see that Staten Island has the least amount of rats and Brooklyn has the most amount of rats, in terms of absolute numbers.

This line graphs shows a similar story to the line graph above, showing the distribution of the total population as well as showing the cumulative number of rats in NYC. However, these two line graphs don't tell the whole story as density of rats also plays a factor.

## Scatterplot

![Scatterplot](\img\initial_vis\mari_graphNYCRatio20_3x5.png)

New Yorkers tend to affiliate themselves to their boroughs and they're neighborhood. To show a little more granularity, each point on this scatterplot shows New York City's 42 Neighborhoods.

We based our neighborhoods on this [Github Repo](https://github.com/erikgregorywebb/nyc-housing/blob/master/Data/nyc-zip-codes.csv)

The X-Axis shows the Rat to Human Ratio, meaning the higher up your neighborhood's point is on the scatterplot, the closer it making the myth of there being one rat per person in New York City, true.

The Y-Axis shows the Rat per Square Meter. So, on average if all the rats were equally spaced out. You would find one rat every 45 ~ 50 square meters or 500 square feet in Bushwick & Williamsburg. On the other hand, You would need to cover double the area to find one if you were in Northwest Brooklyn.
