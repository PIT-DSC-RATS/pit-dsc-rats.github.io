## Problems with Mark-Recapture

The erraticity of our numbers looks to be far beyond the realm of margin for error. For instance, in the year 2011 in ZIP Code 10022 our math says 4,400 Rats. the following year it says 26,400. Is the our math wrong or is there some hidden problem in our collected data? Or is it something else? It turns out that with 4 heads it's quite difficult to mess up copying a formula. So, what was the problem?

## A Problem with Proportion

--- Talk about the problem where some zip codes will have good and bad years/ months where they either don't report anything at all, resulting in very low numbers. Or Bad times where there's so many calls about Rat Sightings that the "population" in that area skyrockets to 3x or more in a year ---
