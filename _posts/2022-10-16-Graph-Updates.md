## A Better Scatterplot

After some feedback, it seemed like the **"Rats Ratio 2020"** scatterplot overall was not too helpful. The **"Rat / Square Meter"** metric was unable to convey it's intended purpose. So, we've updated the graph and this time we made it interactive, it now features a list of neighborhoods that you can toggle on and off. Additionally, if you hover over a point in the scatterplot it will show you information such as: the estimated number of People, Rats, and the Ratio between the two.
