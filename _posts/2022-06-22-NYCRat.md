## What the media says about it

Similar to how there's no shortage of rats in New York City, there doesn't seem to be a shortage of media covering the city's rat problem either. The pandemic and the shut downs that came along with it exacerbated a problem that the city was already struggling to deal with.

[The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/19/new-york-city-rat-problem-vigilantes-with-dogs) wrote about a group of "rat vigilantes" that make use of the hunting instincts of their dogs to deal with the rats. With a supposed **40% increase in Rat Sightings** in the first 11 months of 2021 when compared to 2019 tt seems like these vigilantes aren't having much of an effect.

[The New York Post says that it's out of control](https://nypost.com/2022/06/01/nyc-has-a-major-rat-problem-and-its-not-doing-enough/) and that the city government **isnt** doing enough to stop it. As stated in the article, from January to April of 2022 there were around 7,400 calls about rat sightings — compared to the same time period in 2021 which only had around 6,510 calls. One has to agree that with the pandemic and the city's lack of response to it's rat problem, the myth of there being one rat per person in NYC might one day come true.

Even Youtube is getting in on it with [Cheddar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rNvxML07CU) doing a 12-minute short on Why New York Has So Many Rats. [VICE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jL0x5oBFC1w) also covered the story of the vigilantes mentioned above.

## What has been done about it?

In the past 10 years there has only been one large push for the fight against rats. Former Mayor Bill de Blasio unveiled a [$32 million dollar effort in 2017](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/19/new-york-city-rat-problem-vigilantes-with-dogs) a multi-agency plan to reduce the city’s rat population that targets the three most infested parts of city: the Grand Concourse area, Chinatown/East Village/Lower East Side and Bushwick/Bedford-Stuyvesant. This interagency initiative aims to reduce rat activity by up to 70 percent in the targeted zones by minimizing food sources and available habitats.

The current New York City Mayor Eric Adams has also some plans, but New Yorkers are quite pessimistic about it. Adams mentioned in a press conference that [starting in April 2023, fines will be issued to New Yorkers that put their trash on the curb before 8:00 PM](https://www.npr.org/2022/10/20/1130150756/new-york-rats-trash-rule-mayor-eric-adams) a four hour difference from the 4:00 PM policy that we have currently. Will the four hours have an impact? Only time will tell.
