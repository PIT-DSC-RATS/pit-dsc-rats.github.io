## What the media says about it

Similar to how there's no shortage of rats in New York City, there doesn't seem to be a shortage of media coverage covering the city's rat problem either. The pandemic and the shut downs that came along with it exacerbated a problem that the city was already struggling to deal with.

[The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/19/new-york-city-rat-problem-vigilantes-with-dogs) wrote about a group of "rat vigilantes" that make use of the hunting instincts of their dogs to deal with rats. With a supposed 40% increase in Rat Sightings of 40% in the first 11 months of 2021 compared to 2019. So, it seems like the vigilantes aren't having much of an effect either.

[The New York Post says that it's out of control](https://nypost.com/2022/06/01/nyc-has-a-major-rat-problem-and-its-not-doing-enough/) and that the city government is doing enough to stop it. In the article it mentions that from January to April of 2022 there were around 7,400 calls about rat sightings. Compared to the same months in 2021 of around 6510 calls. One has to agree that with the pandemic and the city's lack of response to it's rat prolem the myth of there being one rat per person in NYC might one day come true.

Even Youtube is getting in on it with Cheddar doing a 12-minute short on [Why New York Has So Many Rats](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rNvxML07CU).

## What has been done about it?

In the past 10 years there has only been one large push for the fight against rats. Former Mayor Bill de Blasio unveiled a [$32 million dollar effort in 2017](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/19/new-york-city-rat-problem-vigilantes-with-dogs). The current New York City Mayor [Eric Adams has some plans, but New Yorkers are quite pessimistic about it.](https://www.npr.org/2022/10/20/1130150756/new-york-rats-trash-rule-mayor-eric-adams) One of the plans being, fining New Yorkers that put their trash on the curb before 8:00 PM. How well will this work? Only time will tell.
